4 Pillars of Object Oriented Programing

Abstraction - exposing only what is needed and hiding other details e.g phone
Inheritance - getting the properties from another class and using the own one also, e.g tutors
Enscapulsation - bank account, restricting / control of data who sees what
Polymorphism - performing  a single different functions, e.g Bill gates performs Founder, Businessman, philantrophis, father...

Types of testing in software (Unit Testing, Integration Testing, Functional Testing, System Testing, Stress Testing, Acceptance Testing, Regression Testing)

Unit Testing
Testing individual units
Low-level testing
Mostly done by developers
Normally dependencies are ignored


Integration Testing
Verifying integrations among software components
Integration between software and hardware

Functional Testing
Tests the functions
Verifying proper outputs
Implementation of the functions are ignored while testing

Sytem Testing
Testing whether the software is working in different systems or not
Testing web applications in different browsers
Can be tested only when the system is fully implemented

Stress Testing
Is tested under extreme conditions
Being tested beyond the limit of specificatios
How much load can the software take?

Acceptance Testing
Tested by customer
Checks if all the requirments are fulfilled
Working as expected

Regression Testin
Is done after any changes take place in code, system, or settings
Make sure that the new implementation doesnt break the software

Microsoft Visual Studio
---------------------------
Visual Studio cannot start debugging because the debug target 'C:\Users\GLENFRAN\source\repos\HelloWorldiReposFldr\HelloWorldiReposFldr\bin\Debug\HelloWorldiReposFldr.exe' is missing. Please build the project and retry, or set the OutputPath and AssemblyName properties appropriately to point at the correct location for the target assembly.
